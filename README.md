## Artist Statement
A visual arts project capturing the collective feelings of the tweeting 
part of humanity one hour and three words at a time.

This project was done as aprt of a school project with the purpose of: 

1. demonstrating how simple and cheap hardware and Open Source software can 
be used to mine the Internet for data.

2. explore new directions of integrating computer science with the visual arts.

3. to juxtapose vastness and complexity of
human expression in the twitterverse with the prosaic and simple
expression of three words that capture the prevailing feeling of the
tweeting part of humanity at this hour.

This repository contains the code for this project. The code runs on a 
Raspberry Pi 3, the output is displayed on a repurposed monitor. The 
installation is located in a classroom in a highschool in Edmonton, 
Canada.
