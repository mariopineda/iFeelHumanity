## Capturing the collective feelings of the tweeting part of humanity since 2016

 #iFeelHumanity is a visual arts project capturing the collective feelings of the tweeting part of humanity - one hour and three words at a time. The art installation is located in a classroom in a high school in Edmonton, Canada, and is run on a Raspberry Pi 3. The collective feelings of humanity is presented on a repurposed monitor in a gilded frame placed on a plain white background. While the image may appears static it refreshes itself every hour while tweeting out the message as well.

The three words summarizing the collective feelings of humanity are obtained by searching 10000 recent tweets for the phrase "I feel". The tweets are cleaned by removing inappropriate language and stop words and te remaining words are collated into a frequency table. The three words most aptly describing the collective feelings of the tweeting part of humanity during this hour are sampled randomly from the top 20 most common words.

The aim of this project was threefold:

1. Demonstrating how simple and cheap hardware and Open Source software can be used to mine the Internet with interactions between different programing languages.

2. Explore novel directions of integrating computer science and the visual arts.

3. To juxtapose the vastness and complexity of human expression of the twitterverse with the prosaic and simple expression of three words intended to capture a snapshot of the prevailing feelings of the tweeting part of humanity any given hour.
