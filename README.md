## Artist Statement
A visual arts project capturing the collective feelings of the tweeting part of humanity one hour and three words at a time.

This project was done as part of a school project with the purpose of: 

1. Demonstrating how simple and cheap hardware and Open Source software can be used to mine the Internet with interactions between diffrent programing languages.

2. Explore novel directions of integrating computer science with the visual arts.

3. To juxtapose vastness and complexity of human expression in the twitterverse with the prosaic and simple expression of three words intended to capture a snapshot of the prevailing feelings of the tweeting part of humanity any given hour.

This repository contains the code for this project. The code runs on a Raspberry Pi 3, the output is displayed on a repurposed monitor. The art installation is located in a classroom in a highschool in Edmonton, Canada.
