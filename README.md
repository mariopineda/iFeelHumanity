## Artist Statement
A visual arts project capturing the collective feelings of the tweeting part of humanity one hour and three words at a time.

The aim of this project was threefold:

1. Demonstrating how simple and cheap hardware and Open Source software can be used to mine the Internet with interactions between different programing languages.

2. Explore novel directions of integrating computer science and the visual arts.

3. To juxtapose the vastness and complexity of human expression of the twitterverse with the prosaic and simple expression of three words intended to capture a snapshot of the prevailing feelings of the tweeting part of humanity any given hour.

This repository contains the code for this project. The code runs on a Raspberry Pi 3, the output is displayed on a repurposed monitor. The art installation is located in a classroom in a highschool in Edmonton, Canada.
